## Test

Caveat: before running tests, you need to install dependencies first. and run `make build` to build the project.

`.env` file:

```bash
CHROME_DATA=/tmp/junt-test
CHROME_BIN=/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome
CHROME_PORT=9222
```

for the first time, you need to run Chrome and login to Linkedin, Glassdoor, and Indeed. Also install Junt extension. e.g.

```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=$(pwd)/tmp/junt-test --load-extension=Your_Project_Path/dist
```

Then run: `make test`

## Publish

Version number is managed by `package.json`. You can use `npm version` to bump version.

```bash
make build
```
